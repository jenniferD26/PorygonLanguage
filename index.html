</a>Motivation</h3>

        <p>Geometry is a common subject that a large amount of students and professionals alike have trouble with, mostly due to the tedious need to memorize a large number formulas that develop such a broad subject and, also, due to the potential requirement to solve long and complex calculations. These issues serve as the main motivation for the creation of Porygon. </p>
        
</a>Overview</h3>
    
    <p>The Porygon project is a programming language that will make it easy to apply formulas when necessary and to solve long calculations in a fast, efficient and user-friendly way. The user will be able to insert partial data of a geometric shape to then find the remaining properties of the constructed shape and determine properties of a certain shape. The properties of the shapes will vary depending on the type of shape, while some general properties such as area will be included in every shape. With Porygon, most of geometryâ€™s calculations will be just a line of code away.</p>
